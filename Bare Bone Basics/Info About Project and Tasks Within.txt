There are no special tasks in this one just demonstrating how i like to set up my projects and why.

Notes:
*	My projects are made as console applications because that allows me to use the command prompt
interface provided to output information while the program is running and it allows me to clearly see patterns
while debugging or just running the program itself.
*	Console Applications close when they reach the end of the Main() sub so they must be put into a loop.
*	You MUST INCLUDE my Open() sub for all forms otherwise they will be on the same thread as the console
which is stuck in a loop. If you do not then you will not be able to interact with your forms.
